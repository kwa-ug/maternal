                        From the moment you get the news that you are pregnant, you will probably be filled with a rush of emotions – and most likely a flood of questions too. While the first trimester of pregnancy is filled with a host of changes for you and for your baby, many will be invisible to the outside world. Read on to find out what happens to your body and how to stay healthy.

                            A full-term pregnancy lasts around 9 months, and most people (including your doctors and midwives) will break this up into 3 ‘trimesters’. Although you are pregnant from the moment of conception – when a male sperm fertilises your ovum (egg) – the first trimester of pregnancy is counted from the first day of your last period through to week 12 . This is because most women who conceive naturally won’t know the date of conception.
                            Trimesters are a helpful way to think about pregnancy because the changes that happen to you and your baby fall into the 3 broad categories of early, middle and late pregnancy, called first, second and third trimesters. </p>

                            For some women, the first trimester is characterised by nausea (often called ‘morning sickness’, although it can occur at any time of day). But remember that every pregnancy is different and while some women have food cravings , others experience food aversions , and some have no change in appetite at all. 
                            Other changes in the first trimester include changes to your breasts as they become tender, larger and heavier, while your uterus will grow and put pressure on your bladder so that you need to urinate more often .

                            Through the first trimester, your baby goes from being a fertilised ovum to a fetus of about 6cm in length at 12 weeks. By the end of the first trimester, your baby’s heart is starting to beat, and the brain, stomach and intestines are developing. There are little bumps known as 'buds' where arms and legs are starting to grow. </p>

                            Your antenatal (pregnancy) health checks might be with your GP , a midwife or an obstetrician , depending on where you will give birth. During your first antenatal health check , you will probably have your pregnancy confirmed with a urine or blood test. These are more reliable than home pregnancy tests . First trimester antenatal health checks usually happen every 4 to 6 weeks, but this can vary, based on your health and how your baby develops. Many women are offered an ultrasound scan at around 12 weeks – you might hear the baby’s heartbeat at this scan. This ultrasound will also show if you are having a multiple birth (e.g. twins) and can help estimate the baby’s size and due date, as well as check for some health conditions. </p>

                            It is safest not to drink any alcohol while you are pregnant, since even low-level drinking, particularly in the first trimester of pregnancy, can have long-term negative effects on your baby.

                            Try to eat a variety of nutritious foods during pregnancy since this will help meet your baby’s nutritional requirements, as well as your own. While the amount of food you need to eat during your first trimester won’t increase by much, you will need more of some nutrients. Most women will also need folic acid and iodine supplements because it's difficult to get enough of these from food alone.

                            Pregnancy can be a wonderful and exciting time, but it’s also important to expect to feel some occasional days of heightened anxiety or low mood .

                            Sometimes one or both parents experience difficult emotions during pregnancy , such as being worried about the birth or about coping as a parent.
                            <br>
                            Feelings of anxiety are not uncommon, and some women will experience symptoms of a condition called anxiety disorder. Antenatal depression is a mood disorder that includes intense emotional changes beyond those you might expect during pregnancy.

                            If you are worried about feelings of anxiety , low mood or depression, you could:

                            Your baby will be able to move freely within the amniotic sac in your uterus. By about week 19 (or sooner if this isn’t your first pregnancy), you may feel this movement – as a faint tickling or fluttering. During these 3 months, your baby’s organs will continue to develop and the liver, pancreas and kidneys all start to function. This is also the time when babies might start to suck their thumb. By week 20 your baby can hear sounds, including the sound of your heartbeat, and they are learning to recognise your voice, although the ears are not yet fully formed.</p>

                            <br>
                            At all visits during your second trimester, you will have your blood pressure checked, and your hands and feet will also be checked for swelling . You might be weighed, have blood taken for tests and have your urine checked.
                            <br>
                            Your doctor or midwife will check your abdomen to monitor your baby’s growth and will listen to your baby’s heartbeat. If you didn’t have an ultrasound in your first trimester, you may be offered one at around 18 to 20 weeks.

                            Eating well and staying active is as important as ever during pregnancy - it's good for your physical and emotional health, and good for your baby too. Light-to-moderate exercise in pregnancy is usually safe: consider walking, swimming, yoga and stationary cycling in your second trimester. High-impact exercise and activities where there is a risk of falling, getting hurt especially around the stomach or overheating are not recommended.
                            <br>
                            Your choice of food during your pregnancy is also important – but that doesn’t mean ‘eating for two’. What you eat during your pregnancy has been shown to affect how your baby grows as well as your baby’s health later in life.

                        Once you reach the third trimester of pregnancy, you’re well over half way there. As you look forward to the birth of your baby, there is plenty to plan for and decisions to make. You might find you’re slowing down, or you might be filled with energy to clean, tidy and organise as you prepare for your baby’s arrival. This urge to clean is known as the ‘nesting’ instinct.

                            Pregnancy is defined in three-month blocks of and third trimesters. Reaching of your pregnancy means that you’re now in the third and final trimester. Officially, this trimester continues to , but in reality, the trimester will end whenever your baby is born.
                            <br>
                            Pregnancy is divided into 3 blocks of 3 months each – the first , second and third trimesters. Reaching week 27 of your pregnancy means you’re now in the third and final trimester. While this trimester could end at week 40 , in reality it ends whenever your baby is born.
                            <br>
                            A baby is considered to have been born full-term if it is born in weeks 37 to 42 of pregnancy. A baby born before week 37 is considered premature , and if your baby has not been born by week 42 , labour may be induced .

                            As you get closer to the time your baby will be born, here are some things you’ll notice:
                            <br>
                            Your skin and ligaments continue to stretch to accommodate your growing baby.You get tired easily, and sleeping becomes more difficult.
                            <br>
                            You experience heartburn and or breathlessness, as the baby grows in your abdomen.
                            <br>
                            While these are all part of a normal pregnancy, you can take steps to minimise discomfort. Speak with your doctor or midwife for suggestions, particularly if you are in pain.
                            <br>
                            If this is your first baby, you may notice around 36 weeks that your baby has moved further down into your pelvis. This is often referred to as 'the baby has engaged or dropped'. You will notice more room near your ribs and breathing will become easier, but this also adds more pressure on your bladder (meaning more trips to the toilet).
                            <br>
                            In the last few weeks of this trimester your body begins to prepare for the coming labour. The cervix begins to soften, and many women notice a ‘show’. The ‘show’ is the release of the mucous plug that sits within the cervical canal during pregnancy, and is an early sign that your labour will soon begin.

                            During this last stage of pregnancy, you may be worried or anxious about labour and the birth, or about how you will manage as a parent .
                            <br>
                            Difficulty getting comfortable in bed and frequent bathroom visits can mean poor sleep, which is known to trigger irritability and low mood in some people.
                            <br>
                            Although most pregnant women see the third trimester as an exciting time and feel positive about the next stage, one in 5 will experience antenatal anxiety or depression. Seek help early if this is how you (or your partner) are feeling.

                            By week 31 , your baby’s lungs are more mature, but are yet to produce surfactant, a substance that helps with breathing once they are born.

                            By week 36, your baby is about 47cm long and weighs approximately 2.6kg. Your baby’s head may start to engage or sit lower into your pelvis at this time, getting ready for labour. Around one in 25 of all babies will be in the ‘breech position’, rather than the usual head-down position, at the start of labour. If this is your situation, your doctor or midwife will discuss with you what this means for your labour, what your options are and how your baby might be born.
                            <br>
                            By 40 weeks, your baby will be about 50cm, and weigh approximately 3.4kg. Developmentally, your baby is now ready to be born.

                            To give your baby a healthy start, it’s important to eat healthy foods throughout pregnancy. Ensure your diet is varied and includes a range of fresh fruit and vegetables as well as sources of protein, iron and calcium. Don’t forget to drink plenty of water too.
                            <br>
                            Weight gain is a normal part of pregnancy and most women can expect to gain between 11 and 16kg.

                            A pregnancy weight gain calculator can be a handy tool to track your weight gain through the third trimester.

                            Try to stay active throughout pregnancy - even in your third trimester. While it's important to stick with safe, gentle exercise as you get closer to your due date, recommendations state that pregnant women without complications are encouraged to participate in regular exercise as part of a healthy lifestyle.
