                    <p>Immediately at birth, all babies should be dried thoroughly and their breathing assessed. The cord should be clamped and cut only after 1–3 minutes, unless the baby needs resuscitation. Routine suctioning must not be done. </p>
                    <p>During the first hour after birth, the baby should be in skin-to-skin contact with the mother for warmth and the initiation of breastfeeding.</p>
                    <p>A full clinical examination including weight, danger signs, eyes, cord and other preventive care should be done around 1 hour after birth, when the baby has had his/her first breastfeed. This care includes giving vitamin K prophylaxis and hepatitis B vaccination as soon as possible after birth (within 24 hours).</p>
                    <p>When skilled health personnel attend the newborn, whether at home or in a facility, additional care should be provided.</p>
                    <p>This care includes basic newborn resuscitation with bag and mask for newborns not breathing spontaneously and full clinical examinations at the recommended times</p>
                    <p>There are four recommended postnatal checkups and at each of the checkups, your newborn child should be assessed for key clinical signs of severe illness and referred as needed. Nine clinical signs have been identified as danger signs that can be identified at home or by a skilled provider in a health facility.</p>
                    <p>The following signs should be assessed during each postnatal care contact, and the newborn should be referred for further evaluation if any of the signs is present: </p>

                     <ul>
                            <li>The child stops feeding well. </li>
                            <li>The child has a history of convulsions.</li>
                            <li>Fast breathing (breathing rate of ≥60 per minute).</li>
                            <li>Severe chest in-drawing.</li>
                            <li>The child gives no spontaneous movement.</li>
                            <li> High body temperature.</li>
                            <li>Low body temperature.</li>
                            <li>Jaundice in first 24 hours of life, or yellow palms and soles at any age.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Please be encouraged to seek health care early if they identify any of the above danger signs in between postnatal care visits.</p>
                    <p>Please continue with early and exclusive breastfeeding within delivery settings including Antenatal care, at delivery, and in all postnatal care visits. This helps to reduce the risks of mortality and morbidity in the first month of life and improves post-neonatal outcomes. It also encourages improved birth spacing by delaying the return to fecundity. </p>
                    <p>Consider the use of chlorhexidine for umbilical cord care for babies born at home to reduce newborn mortality. For newborns who are born at home in settings with high neonatal mortality it is recommended to apply chlorhexidine (7.1% chlorhexidine digluconate aqueous solution or gel, delivering 4% chlorhexidine) daily to the umbilical cord stump during the first week of life. This is a new recommendation, a clean, dry cord care remains the standard recommendation for newborns born in health facilities and at home in low neonatal mortality settings. The use of chlorhexidine in these situations may be considered only to replace application of a harmful traditional substance, such as cow dung, to the cord stump.p>
                    <p>Make sure that your baby is exclusively breastfed from birth until 6 months of age. Please seek counselling and support for Exclusive Breastfeeding at each postnatal contact.</p>
                    <p>Bathing of the child should be delayed until 24 hours after birth. If this is not possible due to cultural reasons, bathing should be delayed for at least 6 hours.  To ensure the health of the child, please dress the infant in appropriate clothing of for ambient temperature. This means one to two layers of clothes more than adults, and use of hats/caps. The mother and baby should not be separated and should stay in the same room 24 hours a day. Please take time to Communicate and play with the newborn child.</p>
